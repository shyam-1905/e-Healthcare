<h2>Water for relief from stomach pain</h2>
<div class="description">
<p dir="ltr">We all know the benefits of drinking an adequate amount of water daily. It promotes digestion and facilitates the easy passage of stool. Water can also help to get relief from abdominal pain caused due to gas build up and <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/constipation">constipation</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Read more: <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/tips/pachan-shakti-badhane-ke-liye-ayurvedic-upay-in-hindi">How to improve digestion</a>)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>Your daily fluid intake should be 2-3 litres on average. This includes entire fluid intake, but one should stick with plain water as the major fluid.</li>
<li>If your abdominal pain is due to <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/indigestion">indigestion</a>, increase your fluid intake to improve digestion and get rid of gas buildup.</li>
<li>If you do not like to drink plain water, you can always add a few drops of <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/tips/nimbu-ke-fayde-aur-nuksan-in-hindi">lemon</a> or infuse it with some fruit or vegetable. Soft drinks and sports drinks can also be used but in moderation. Avoid caffeinated drinks because it may worsen the condition.</li>
<li>In case you are having abdominal pain due to diarrhoea, increase your intake of oral rehydration solution. It will help you to replenish the electrolyte imbalance and prevent <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/dehydration">dehydration</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">A hot water bath or a hot compression bag is used for relieving abdominal pain associated with intestinal spasms. This is because the warmth from water relaxes vigorous muscle contractions responsible for spasms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, if you are suffering from acidity or <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/heartburn">heartburn</a>, do not go to bed or lie down. This would prevent the acid buildup in your stomach from moving upwards through your digestive tract.</p>

Probiotics are very useful if you are suffering from infectious diarrhoea or irritable bowel syndrome. Probiotic solutions are easily available in the market. However, one homemade probiotic that you can use is curd.</p>
