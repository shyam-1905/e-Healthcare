<h2>Cold packs for reducing fever</h2>
<div class="description">
 <p>This is the simplest and easiest thing you can do while suffering from fever. It demands almost zero effort. You don&#39;t need to get up and prepare certain potions or complex preparations in an attempt to drop your body temperature down to normal. All you have to do is grab a bowl of cold water and a cotton handkerchief. You can also ask your family or friends to apply a cold pack on you while following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a bowl of cold water and cotton, soft handkerchief</li>
<li>Wet the piece of cloth with water, squeeze the excess liquid out</li>
<li>Put it over your forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, abdomen or lower leg</li>
<li>Repeat the cold pack application for at last 15 minutes for relief</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using chilled water or ice cubes for a cold pack, as it may cause shivering thereupon elevate your core body temperature., This could lead to further adverse effects.</li>
<li>Another option is taking lukewarm water bath (water temperature between 29 to 32 &deg;C) in order to bring some comfort. However, this should only be done 30 minutes after taking medicine, otherwise, you may end up with an even higher fever.&nbsp;Taking lukewarm water bath may not necessarily decrease the temperature but it certainly eases the discomfort and give you a relaxed feeling. This is called treating symptoms or symptomatic treatment.</li>
</ul>

<a name="calcium-to-reduce-fever"></a>
<h2>Calcium to reduce fever</h2>
<div class="description">
<p>Do you calcium fights infections? This could be surprising for you, but according to a book by Dr Bernard Jenson, fever tends to draw ionizable calcium from your bones and make it available in the blood to fight against infections. This is the reason why when you do a blood test while having a fever, your calcium level will show some spike. Hence, to help your body fight against infections, nourish your body with an extra dose of calcium rather than getting your bones invaded for stored calcium.</p>
<p>An article published in the &lsquo;Proceedings of The Western Pharmacological Society&rsquo; suggests that oral supplements of calcium and vitamin D&nbsp;is effective in improving the symptoms and overall condition of dengue patients.</p>

<p>So, if you want to get better, feed your body with calcium-rich foods like milk, egg, yoghurt, and cheese. Moreover, you can also take calcium supplements if you don&#39;t feel like eating or are suffering from the loss of appetite.</p>
<p>However, there is a caveat: you should never devoid yourself from food during sickness as food is the only source of energy and nutrients, which help strengthen your immune system, leading to quick recovery from illness.</p>

<a name="chicken-soup-for-fever"></a>
<h2>Chicken soup for fever</h2>
<div class="description">
<p>Another healthy option to get over your fever troubles is having the bowl of ultimate goodness in the shape of chicken broth or soup, that is of course if you are a non-vegetarian.</p>
<p>You may have heard about this healthy food remedy through your grandmother or ancestors. Well, it seems like they are absolutely right in their assessment. A bowl of chicken soup contains almost every nutrient your body needs for rapid healing. And yes, it is rich in calcium too. Chicken soup is especially beneficial for you if you are suffering from fever that arises from upper respiratory tract infection,cold or flu.</p>
<p>Studies demonstrate that chicken soup inhibits neutrophil (a white blood cell) migration and has anti-inflammatory activity. This could be the reason behind the potential medicinal value of chicken broth.</p>
