<h2><header><center>Home remedies for Canker Sores</center></h2></header>
<br>
<br>
    <p>
    Canker sores (aphthous ulcers) occur inside your mouth or on your gums. Although they can be painful and make it difficult to talk or eat, they usually don’t cause lasting damage. Most canker sores heal on their own within a couple of weeks.
    
    Several home remedies can help speed up the healing process, but they’re no magic bullet. It’s unlikely any remedy will cure a canker sore overnight. Many home remedies for canker sores aren’t well-studied, so use with caution
    </p>

    <h2>1. Alum powder</h2>
    <p>
        <br>
    Alum powder is made from potassium aluminum sulfate. It’s often used to preserve food and to pickle vegetables. Alum has astringent properties that may help shrink tissues and dry out canker sores.
    
    To use:
    <ul style="list-style-type: square num;">
    <li>Create a paste by mixing a tiny amount of alum powder with a drop of water.</li>
    <li>Dab the paste onto a canker sore.</li>
    <li>Leave on for at least 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Rinse your mouth thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Repeat daily until your canker sore is gone.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
<h2>2. Salt water rinse</h2>
<br>
<p>Rinsing your mouth with salt water is a go-to home remedy, although a painful one, for mouth sores of any kind. It may help dry out canker sores.

    To use:
<ul>
<li>Dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in 1/2 cup of warm water.</li>
<li>Swirl this solution in your mouth for 15 to 30 seconds, then spit it out.
    </li>
<li>Repeat every few hours as needed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Baking soda rinse</h2><br>
<p>
    Baking soda is thought to restore pH balance and reduce inflammation, which may heal canker sores.

To use:
<ul>

<li>Dissolve 1 teaspoon of baking soda in 1/2 cup of water.</li>
<li>Swirl this solution in your mouth for 15 to 30 seconds, then spit it out.</li>
<li>Repeat every few hours as needed.</li>
<p>Baking soda won’t harm you if swallowed, but it’s super salty, so try to avoid doing so.</p>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>4. Hydrogen peroxide</h2><br>
<p>

    Hydrogen peroxide promotes healing of a canker sore by cleaning the sore and reducing bacteria in your mouth.

To use:
<ul>
    <li>Dilute a 3 percent solution of hydrogen peroxide with equal parts water.</li>
    <li>Dip a cotton ball or cotton swab into the mixture.</li>
    <li>Apply the mixture directly to your canker sore a few times daily.</li>
    
<p>You can also use diluted hydrogen peroxide as a mouth rinse. Swish the rinse around your mouth for about a minute, and then spit it out.</p>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Milk of magnesia</h2><br>
    <p>
        Milk of magnesia contains magnesium hydroxide. It’s an acid neutralizer and a laxative. Used orally, it may change the pH in your mouth so the sore can’t thrive. It also coats the sore to help prevent irritation and relieve pain.

        To use:
        <ul>
            <li>Apply a small amount of milk of magnesia to your canker sore.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for several seconds, then rinse.</li>
            <li>Repeat up to three times daily.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
<h2>6. Sage mouthwash</h2><br>
<p>
    Sage tea has traditionally been used to treat mouth inflammation. Sage mouthwash works as a general mouth rinse for many oral problems. It has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and astringent properties. It may also help relieve pain.

    You can find sage mouthwash in most pharmacies and use as directed. Or you can make your own sage rinse:
    <ul>
        <li>Add boiling water to 1 to 2 tablespoons of fresh sage leaves.</li>
        <li>Steep for at least 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain and let the solution cool.</li>
        <li>Swish the rinse around your mouth for a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Swallow the rinse or spit it out.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>
<h2>7. DGL mouthwash</h2><br>
<p>
    DGL mouthwash is made from deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), an herbal licorice extract. It’s thought to have anti-inflammatory abilities and is considered a natural remedy for stomach ulcers. DGL is available in supplement form, which you can use to make mouthwash.

    To use:
    <ul>
        <li>Mix the powder of one DGL capsule (200 milligrams) with 1 cup of warm water.</li>
        <li>Swish the solution around your mouth for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spit it out.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DGL is also available as a mouth patch to help shrink canker sores. You apply the patch to a sore and leave it in place for at least 30 minutes. If you think the patch is a good option for you, talk to your doctor or dentist about where to purchase it.</p>
</p>
<br>
<h2>8. Zinc lozenges</h2><br>
<p>
    If your immune system is weak, canker sores may thrive. Zinc is a mineral that boosts your immunity. Taking zinc lozenges regularly may help your immune system fight off bacteria that cause canker sores. It may also decrease healing time once you have a sore.

    Zinc lozenges are available online and at most pharmacies. They may contain other ingredients such as echinacea. You usually dissolve one in your mouth. Check the manufacturer’s directions to see how often you should do so.
   
</p>
<br>
<h2>9. Vitamin B complex supplement</h2><br>
<p>
    You may get canker sores more often if your diet is low in vitamin B-12. It’s unclear exactly how vitamin B-12 heals canker sores, however.

    According to a 2017 study, participants taking 1,000 micrograms of vitamin B-12 daily had fewer canker sore outbreaks, fewer sores overall, and less pain than those taking a placebo.
    
    Other B vitamins may also help. A vitamin B complex supplement contains all eight B vitamins, including B-12. Vitamin B complex supplements may cause side effects, so consult your doctor before use.
    
</p>
<br>

<h2>
    When to see your doctor
</h2><br>
<p>
    Most canker sores aren’t cause for concern. They seldom leave behind lasting side effects. Still, some canker sores justify a call to your doctor.

Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>The sore is larger than normal.</li>
        <li>You have multiple sores.</li>
        <li>New sores form before old ones have healed.</li>
        <li>The sore doesn’t heal after two weeks.</li>
        <li>The sore spreads to your lips.</li>
        <li>The sore causes extreme pain.</li>
        <li>The sore makes eating or drinking intolerable.</li>
        <li>You also have a fever.
        </li>
        <p>You should also contact your doctor or dentist if a jagged or sharp tooth or a dental hygiene tool is the reason for your canker sores.</p>
    </ul>
