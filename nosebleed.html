<p>Nosebleeds could be scary as they usually happen suddenly. Though you might be glad to know that in most cases, bleeding from the nose does not always indicate a health condition. There can be many reasons for a bleeding nose such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nasal irritation</li>
<li>Cold and dry air</li>
<li><a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/injury">Injury</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/sinusitis">Sinusitis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/nasal-septum-deviation">Deviated septum</a></li>
<li>Overuse of nasal sprays</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors create irritation in the membrane of the nasal membrane, causing blood vessels in the nose to rupture and bleed.<br />
As long as the bleeding is not originating from an artery in the posterior end (towards the face) of the nose, it can be easily controlled at home with some simple remedies.<br />
This article discusses such tips and tricks that may help you stop a nosebleed and reduce its risk.</p>

<h2>Nettle leaves to stop nose bleeding</h2>
<div class="description">

<a name="nasal-irrigation-to-stop-nose-bleeding"></a>
<h2>Nasal irrigation to stop nose bleeding</h2>
<div class="description">
<p>Neti pots and nasal irrigation is a type of cleansing procedure in Ayurveda. It involves passing a saline solution through the nose to facilitate removal of excess dust and mucus from the nose and nasal sinuses. Irrigating nasal canal with a saline solution can also help in relieving allergies and infections, which can be the causative reason for bleeding nose.</p>
<p><strong>What you will need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Saline solution</li>
<li>Neti pot</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Lean over a sink</li>
<li>Rotate your head to a side and insert the spout &nbsp;of the neti pot into your upper nostril</li>
<li>Raise the pot so that the solution enters your upper nostril</li>
<li>The solution will come out through the lower nostril rinsing the whole nasal canal</li>
<li>Breathe with your mouth will the process is going on</li>
<li>When the pot is empty, remove the spout and exhale with both your nostrils to clear the left solution</li>
<li>Repeat the process with the other nostril</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you sterilize the neti pot before and after use. Also, use clean water (preferably distilled) to avoid any other infection.</p>

</div>
<div class="category_blue_backdiv">
<a name="humidifier-to-stop-nose-bleeding"></a>
<h2>Humidifier to stop nose bleeding</h2>
<div class="description">
<p>A humidifier is a device that supplies moisture in the air. Low humidity can make your nasal canal dry and create irritation. This is usually the reason for nose bleeding in dry winter and summer months. In such cases, always keep a humidifier in your room to prevent yourself from nose bleeding. But there are some precautions one should take while using it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the humidifier at a distance. Approx 2 meters is enough.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t use the humidifier for long. Too much humidity for long can lead to the growth of moulds (fungi).</li>
<li>Clean the humidifier daily to avoid the growth of infection-causing microbes on its surface. Also, change its water regularly.</li>
<li>Try using distilled water to avoid the accumulation of minerals in the device. If these mineral particles are released in the air, they can cause breathing problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional benefits, you can also add extracts of some herbal plants with astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. As these extracts heat up, they release their active compounds in the air, which help promote recovery on inhalation.&nbsp;<br />
In case you do not have a humidifier, here is a trick you can follow.</p>
<p><strong>What you will need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean utensil</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Gas stove</li>
<li>Herb</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take some water in a clean utensil</li>
<li>Boil the water</li>
<li>You can add some herbs with astringent property to this boiling water</li>
<li>Once water is heated enough, inhale the &nbsp;steam</li>
<li>Make sure to cover yourself enough to keep the steam from escaping.</li>
<li>When done properly, this procedure will keep your nasal canal moist and also deliver the medicinal property of the herbal plant to your nasal mucosa.</li>

<div class="description">
<p>Essential oils are loaded with active compounds that impart them with various medicinal properties.<br />
They not only help reduce <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/infections">infection</a>&nbsp;and inflammation, which may be the cause of a nosebleed but also they promote quick repair of breached skin and <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/wound-open">open wounds</a>.

<p><strong>What you will need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Essential oil</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Clean</li>
<li>Soft cloth</li>

To check, apply a few drops of essential oil on some other part of the body like your wrist. Wait for a few minutes to check if there is any reaction. Go ahead and use the essential oil if there is no sensitivity or reaction.</p>

<h2>When to visit a doctor for nosebleeds</h2>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p>Nose bleed is mostly of two types namely posterior and anterior. Anterior nose bleed is most common and does not require any medical help. This type of bleeding occurs in the Kiesselbach plexus also known as the little area of the nose. While posterior nose bleed needs prompt attention. This type of bleeding occurs in the sphenopalatine artery in the area inside the nose and may lead to a backflow of blood towards the throat or mouth. Here are a few red flags that indicate an immediate need for medical intervention:</p>
<ul>
<li>In case, bleeding still persists after 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Nose bleeding is because of any serious <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/injury">injury</a> like a <a href="https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/fractured-nose">broken nose</a>.</li>
<li>If the bleeding occurs after an injury to the skull.</li>
<li>Also, consult a doctor if you regularly suffer from nosebleeds.</li>
</ul>
